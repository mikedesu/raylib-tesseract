# update.md

this file will contain instructions on new features and updates to make to the codebase.
the program works incredibly well now, and does the following:
1. opens a window and draws a rotating tesseract
2. allows the user to change scenes by pressing the spacebar
    - scene 1: rotating tesseract on white background with black lines
    - scene 2: rotating tesseract on black background with white lines
    - scene 3: rotating tesseract on black background with colored faces (looks fantastic)
3. allows the user to change axis of rotation with the left and right arrow keys

now, for updating, i'd like to add 3 new scenes after scene 3 that does the following:
1. draws a 4D pyramid that rotates in 4D similar to the tesseract, using black lines on a white background without faces
2. draws a 4D pyramid that rotates in 4D similar to the tesseract, using white lines on a black background without faces
3. draws a 4D pyramid that rotates in 4D similar to the tesseract, using colored faces on a black background
