# instructions.md

you are to produce 2 files:
- main.cpp
- Makefile

this is a raylib project that will:
1. create a 1920x1080 window
2. create a 3d camera and position it at (0, 10, 10)
3. create a simple 3d cube at the origin (0, 0, 0)
4. render the cube lines in the center of the screen with red color

after we have the basic setup, we will add more features in the future
